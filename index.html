        Lamborghini is a brand known for its extroverted styling and brash performance,
        which is embodied perfectly by the V-10–powered Huracán supercar. With 600-plus 
        horsepower roaring just behind the cabin, the Huracán delivers heart-pounding acceleration 
        with a spine-tingling soundtrack to match. It's just as home on the road as it is on a race track,
         and in both situations it delivers the razor-sharp handling you'd expect of a six-figure sports car.
          To turn up the insanity even further, a rally-inspired Huracán Sterrato with a raised suspension, 
          a roof-top snorkel air intake, and special all-terrain tires is ready to do some light off-roading—and in our experience
           it's hilariously fun. The same can be said of the rest of the Huracán lineup, too, and its boisterous personality 
           and extroverted looks imbue it with a charming outrageousness that rivals from Ferrari and McLaren can't quite match. 
       </div>
        <div id="car" class="first">
            The Huracán is rated buy the EPA for 13 mpg in the city and 18 on the highway
             for a combined rating of 15 mpg. Not that anyone in the market for a brand-new Lambo
              will care one way or the other. But it's worth noting that all Huracán models are 
              penalized for their low fuel efficiency ratings with a gas guzzler tax. 
              We haven't had a chance to subject any variant to our 75-mph highway fuel
               economy route, which is part of our extensive testing regimen,
                so we can't comment on the Lambo's real-world efficiency. 
                For more information about the Huracán's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.

            Unlike most cars, infotainment features are arguably the least interesting 
            thing about a six-figure supercar. Still, Lamborghini outfits the Huracán with 
            an 8.4-inch touchscreen that controls functions such as the audio system, climate settings, 
            and other media content. Along with Apple CarPlay capability, the Lambo gets Amazon Alexa integration 
            that provides voice-control technology that should theoretically reduce distracted driving.
